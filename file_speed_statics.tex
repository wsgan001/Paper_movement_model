\subsection{Taxi Status Speed and Duration}
The instantaneous speed distributions for the two status for different time periods are explored.

We calculate the average speed in every hour for vacant and occupied status from November 1 to 7, 2011, shown as Fig.~\ref{figure_avg_speed}. Clearly, occupied taxis drive faster. And the average speed is affected by time, especially for the occupied status. The average speed for the vacant status keep in a low-speed. To further investigate the cumulative speed distribution, proportion for every speed section is calculated and plotted in Fig.~\ref{figure_speed_distribution}. Here, a point at $(5,0.2)$ means $20\%$ records fall in the range $[0,5)km/h$. We also fit the speed to model the microscope behavior (will be discussed in Section \ref{section_modeling}). Fig.~\ref{figure_speed_distribution} shows that speed distribution differs for each status and with strong regularity for each status at corresponding time.
In Fig.~\ref{figure_speed_distribution}(b) from 6:00 to 8:00, curves of Nov 5 and Nov 6 are different from other curves. This may because Nov 5 and Nov 6 are weekend and more workers will get up late at weekend. So the vehicle volume in the weekend morning will decrease so that the speed will increase.
