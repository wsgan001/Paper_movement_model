\subsection{Taxi event distribution}
\label{section_taxi_denstiy_distribution}

To validate $assumption 2$, we quantitatively analyze vehicles density in one hour. By dividing the whole network into $100*100$ grids, taxi density distributions for event 0, 1 are computed in each cell.

\end{figure*}

Figure.\ref{figure_taxi_density_for_one_hour} shows the on/off events distribution in three time sections. In the morning, people begin to get out. so the on-event distribute is more even than that of off-event. this phenomenon may be caused by the on-event spots are mainly at the homes of the citizens, while the off-event spots tend to gather together at workplaces, railway stations or scenic spots. Besides, in the evening, the dispersion of on-event is of lower degree than that of off-event, for people coming home at that time.

The amount of loading passengers in each cell shows geographic feathers:the distribution is uneven, and the difference between on/off-event distributions illustrates the on/off-event regions are different which support the \emph{assumption 2}.
