\subsection{Parameter estimation of speed distribution}
\label{section_speed_modeling}
In this section, we modeling the speed distribution.Because the probability will be influenced by the length of speed range, so we choose the cumulative distribution for modeling. Then we fit the cumulative distribution to get the cumulative probability distribution function, and then take a derivative with it to obtain the speed probability distribution.

Fig.\ref{formular_ccdf_speed} plots the cumulative distribution of speed. From the figure we can get following information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In the speed range from about 0 to 40 km/h, the distributions show a linear relationship. While after the range, an exponential relationship can be observed.
  \item For the status 0, the distributions are similar. But on March.5 and 6, 2011, the curves show more similarity than on the other days. We assume that for March.5 and 6, 2011 are weekend, the speed tend to be smaller than on the weekdays because of the heavy traffic.
  \item For the status 0, the speed distribution differs with each other evenly.
\end{itemize}

We choose a segmented function to fit the cumulative distributions and estimated the parameters. Especially, we respectively discuss the distribution for status 0 on workdays and weekend.
The fit formulas are given as formulas \ref{formular_ccdf_speed}.

\begin{equation}\label{formular_ccdf_speed}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
 g(x)=a*x+b & x \in [0,40]\\
 f(x)=1-exp(-c*x-d)& x\in(40,180]\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}


Fig. \ref{figure_fit_ccdf_speed} also plots the fit results. For status 0, we discuss the condition for that on workdays and weekend. The blue lines represent the fitting results for the speed range $[0,40] km/h$. And the red lines plot the fitting results for speed range $(40,180] km/h$.
We also fit the cumulative speed distribution for status 0 and 1, shown as the right bottom in fig.\ref{figure_fit_ccdf_speed}.

The rms of residuals for each fit are as table \ref{table_rms}.The smaller rms of residuals means better fitting. In the table, the values are all less than 0.01, showing good similarity.
