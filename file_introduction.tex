\section{Introduction}
\label{section_introduction}

In vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs) \cite{4068700}, realistic mobility model is an important way to improve route planning, control traffic situations, or solve the vehicle-to-vehicle communication problems. However, mobility models might influence simulation performance, since mobility model defines the nodal mobility pattern including speed and direction. However, large amount of data are difficult to be utilized directly. It is necessary to work on realistic mobility models. Some researchers \cite{KimKotz-99,HuangZhu-88} modeled the vehicular mobility, extracting different feathers from real data sets. Nevertheless, taxi status is ignored in the previous works.

In this work, a STatus and Region Aware Taxi mobility model, STRAT, is proposed based on the real taxi GPS data. Two assumptions are introduced in section \ref{section_assumptions_anlysis}. We assume that the taxi behavior and geographic features are related with different status. They are verified to be reasonable by the statistical analysis of the data set.
START is modeled based on these assumptions. In the macro scope, instead of simply dividing the area into coarse-grain regions, we classified the area into two set of regions according to the passenger loading or droping event density. When a taxi take a passenger, the current region will be selected from the region set of load-event and the destination region, where the drop-event happens, will be selected from the region set of drop-event. We investigate the relationship between load-event regions and drop-event regions. Paths from the sources to destinations will be found by Dijkstra algorithm. In detailed view, the \emph{speed} for the two taxi statuses are discussed respectively.
Simulations are carried out to compare the similarity of node trace characteristics and contact characteristics. The results show that our mobility model has a good approximation with the real scenario in trace samples, distribution of nodes and the contact characteristics.

The rest of our paper is organized as follows: %%Section \ref{section_related_works} provides an overview of related works on mobility models.
 Section \ref{section_assumptions_anlysis} proposes two assumptions which are further validated by statistical results of real data. Section \ref{section_modeling} presents the modeling process. Simulation results are demonstrated in Section \ref{section_model_varification}. Finally, Section \ref{section_conclusion} concludes this paper.
